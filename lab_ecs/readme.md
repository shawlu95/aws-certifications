## Elastic Container Service

- upload image to elastic container registry
- define a Task Definition, which is a JSON to use the image, and resources
- AWS Fargate is a serverless service for containers
- image definition -> task definition -> clusters -> services -> clusters
- this lab uses "sample-app", and is all done on aws console
